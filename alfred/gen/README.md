# Data Generation

Please refer to [ALFRED dataset code](https://github.com/askforalfred/alfred/tree/master/data) to learn more about the data generation. We provide scripts for generating novel trajectories and rendering existing ones recorded with `traj_data.json` which are based on the original ALFRED scripts.
